// 2709. Greatest Common Divisor Traversal
// Solved
// Hard
// Topics
// Companies
// Hint
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, and you are allowed to traverse between its indices. You can traverse between index i and index j, i != j, if and only if gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1, where gcd is the greatest common divisor.
