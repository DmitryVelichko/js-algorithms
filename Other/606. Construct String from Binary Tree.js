// Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.

// Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
// Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
// Explanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)"
// Example 2:
