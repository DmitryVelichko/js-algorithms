// Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime.

// The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and finished it at time endTime[i].

// Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
// Output: 1
// Explanation: We have 3 students where:
// The first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3 and wasn't doing anything at time 4.

// The third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7 and was the only student doing homework at time 4.
